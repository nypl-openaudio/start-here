# BPL Sampler  
### Short description  
Cut up a person’s Brooklyn Public Library interview into a sampler instrument.  

### Long description  
How can audio storytelling and music combine in a way that encourages people to engage more with the lyrical content? For two Brooklyn Public Library [Our Streets, Our Stories](http://www.bklynlibrary.org/seniors/our-streets-our-stories-o), I’ve created two sampling instruments, [Marty](https://github.com/nypl-openaudio/data-brooklyn-public-library/blob/master/transcripts/text/marty-needelman-0001.text) & [Inez](https://github.com/nypl-openaudio/data-brooklyn-public-library/blob/master/transcripts/text/inez-spencer-0001.text), as well as a basic hip hop beat that you can play over.
