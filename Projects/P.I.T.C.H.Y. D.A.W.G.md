#### Short Description:  
Platform for sharing related media synced with audio.  

#### Links and materials  

#### Long Description  
Module-based curated audio experience based on 3 basic types of Users/Listeners: Audio Only (average listener, just press play); Full Experience (Dynamic Window + Transcript, can listen to audio while getting an enhanced listening experience through Visual Info Cards based on Keywords/Tags); Highlights (Keywords/Tags are indexed and offered as “chapters”, listener can skip forward to sections when a topic of interest is discussed). Potential future enhancements: User-driven Search Tool for the transcript (to serve research needs); Option of choosing Autoplay function during Highlights experience, so user can continue listening if they are enjoying the section they started from; A new use for post-edit transcripts which can create improved Rewind/Fast Forward function based on complete thoughts, sentences, ideas rather than just timestamps; Pulling out metadata and indexing layered conversations (of different speakers) so you can compare them with other audio files.
