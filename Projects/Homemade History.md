#### Short Description:  
Remixing oral history
#### Audience  
School age to baby boomers.  
#### Long description:  
Anyone can contribute to existing oral histories. Using a mobile app (or web portal) one can access the pre-approved NYPL oral history collections via a public version of the Open Transcript Editor, listen and follow along with the transcript and then extract sound clips of interest using a highlight/copy/paste text-based UI; record and edit your own story clips to add to, amplify and comment on the existing histories; mix the results together; add images and tag it; and share the remix of dynamic audio plus images with the world. Results are automatically shared back to NYPLâ€™s oral history production staff to be curated (and further edited, if necessary), transcribed, and republished back to the collections. Further distribution will occur via streaming, podcasting and social media sharing. The NYPL audio production team will have a facilitation guide for users and live online chat to assist with technical operation of the app.  

Wireframe to be prepared along with a business case. An existing audio app will be researched as a possible foundational tool.
