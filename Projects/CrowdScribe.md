## Short Description  
Prototype of chrome extension for requesting and gathering transcriptions   
## Long description:  
Crowdscribe is a proof of concept for a Chrome extension that supports crowdsourced transcriptions. Users can request transcriptions of media using the extension, and users who are on the same webpage at the same time will get a notification to help transcribe media on the page.
