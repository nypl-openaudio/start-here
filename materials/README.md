It is the main research arm of the U.S. Congress and the home of the U.S. Copyright Office.
* Since its launch in 1997, [The Moth](https://themoth.org/) has presented thousands of stories told live and without notes. Moth shows are renowned for the great range of human experience they showcase. Each show starts with a theme, and the storytellers explore it, often in unexpected ways. Since each story is true and every voice authentic, the shows dance between documentary and theater, creating a unique, intimate, and often enlightening experience for the audience.
* [LIVE from the NYPL](http://www.nypl.org/events/live-nypl) is [The New York Public Library](http://www.nypl.org/)'s flagship ticketed event series, offering programs that are as unique and engaging as the Library itself, and embody the institution's mission to educate, inform, and inspire the diverse community it serves in New York and beyond. Under the direction of Paul Holdengräber since it launched in 2005, LIVE's provocative conversations, real debates, irresistible performances and original experiences are exercises in cognitive theater designed to stimulate cultural curiosity. During its Fall and Spring seasons, LIVE welcomes to its stage the literary icons, groundbreaking artists, creative filmmakers, notable historians, influential leaders and emerging tastemakers who are shaping the world today.
* [Visible Lives: Oral Histories of the Disability Experience](http://oralhistory.nypl.org/neighborhoods/visible-lives) is an oral history project by [The New York Public Library Community Oral History Project](http://oralhistory.nypl.org/) that works to both preserve and document a thematic history through personal recollections.

The renowned program reaches a global audience, with over 620 public radio stations broadcasting Fresh Air, and 3 million podcast downloads each week.
* [The World in Words](http://www.pri.org/collections/world-words) by [PRI](http://www.pri.org/) is a podcast about languages and the people who speak them. What happens to the brain on bilingualism? Should we fear the rise of global English? Is the United States losing its linguistic cohesion? Why are Chinese words about technology so inventive? Why does Icelandic have so many cool swearwords? Patrick Cox and Nina Porzucki bring you stories from the world’s linguistic frontlines. (In short, we’re nerdy and wordy.)
