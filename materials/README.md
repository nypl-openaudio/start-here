Under the direction of Paul Holdengräber since it launched in 2005, LIVE's provocative conversations, real debates, irresistible performances and original experiences are exercises in cognitive theater designed to stimulate cultural curiosity. During its Fall and Spring seasons, LIVE welcomes to its stage the literary icons, groundbreaking artists, creative filmmakers, notable historians, influential leaders and emerging tastemakers who are shaping the world today.
