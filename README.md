# Open-Audio

## Wayfinding  
Open Audio Weekend is being held in the Celeste Bartos Forum of The New York Public Library's central branch, the [Stephen A. Schwarzman Building](http://www.nypl.org/locations/schwarzman). The Celeste Bartos Forum is on the ground floor of the library and is accessable through the Library entrance on 42nd Street. This entrance is wheelchair accessible. Upon entering at 42nd Street, the forum is directly opposite this entrance.   

At the start of both Saturday and Sunday, event volunteers will be stations outside the entrance of the forum and available for questions. Throughout the event, staff and volunteers will be available to attendees.

## New to Git or Github?

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a file control system that lets people share and contribute to projects (called “repositories”), most of them software projects (but some people use it for other things, like [taco recipes](https://github.com/sinker/tacofancy)). Github (the website you are on now) is a company that allows anyone to host public Git projects for free.

We will use Git and Github to share the projects made during the Open Audio Weekend. If you're not a programmer, don't worry, sharing files in Github is as easy as dragging and dropping files to your browser! For a quick introduction on creating and updating a repository on Github, read the [Creating a Repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) **(make sure the repository you create is Public)**, [Adding a File to a Repository](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository/), and [Editing Files in your Repository](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/) tutorials. There are more examples in the [Github help](https://help.github.com/). There is also this [great introductory tutorial](http://ablwr.github.io/blog/2014/11/03/non-technical-persons-guide-to-becoming-an-open-source-software-contributor-via-github/) on how to become an open-source software contributor via Github by [Ashley Blewer](//github.com/ablwr).

Event volunteers will be on hand during the event to help out.

> **IMPORTANT:** All code you submit in the Open Audio Weekend should go to repositories you create in the [OpenAudio Organization](//github.com/nypl-openaudio).

### Sharing Your Project

Every team will present their project at the end of Day 2. As [described above](#new-to-git-or-github), every project will have its own repository.

- **Make sure your project includes a README**: select “Initialize this repository with a README” when creating the repository and then [edit the file](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository) or just [add a `README.md` file later](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository) (it is just a regular text file with the `.md` file extension).
- Add this information to your README: project name, team members, project description, and links to all external assets (those outside of the repository). Make sure to take advantage of [Github's text formatting toolbar](https://help.github.com/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github/).

During the final shareout you will use this repository and README as launchpad for your presentation. All projects will be presented from the same computer which will be connected to the projector so make sure to have all the necessary links in there!

## Open Audio Weekend Code of Conduct

In order to foster a productive and welcoming environment for this hackathon, we request that all participants read the [NYPL Rules & Regulations](http://www.nypl.org/help/about-nypl/legal-notices/rules-and-regulations) document, which will serve as the code of conduct for the event.

## Resources  
* [WebAIM: Web Accessibility in Mind](http://webaim.org/resources/)  
Website with a number of excellent resources and services around web accessibility many of which are highlighted in the [Resources Page](http://webaim.org/resources/).

## Prompts
As you know, Open Audio Weekend is a two-day hackathon to make audio accessible for the public good. It’s a big challenge to tackle so we’ve compiled some prompts to stimulate conversations and project ideas!  

* **Discover**: What new experiences can we make around discovery of audio?  
* **Find**: How can we make it easier to search audio?  
* **Listen**: What are some meaningful ways we can augment the experience of listening to audio?  
* **Share**: How can we make it easier to share audio?  
* **Learn**: What can we learn from audio? How can audio be used in an educational context?  
* **Engage**: How can we engage a community through audio?  
* **Access**:  How can we make audio collections more usable for people with disabilities?  

## Slack & Social Media
We’ve set up an instance of Slack for use during the event. For those of you not familiar with Slack, it’s a chatroom allowing group and 1-on-1 conversations. To use the event Slack, just log in at: [togetherwelisten.nypl.org/openaudio/talk](http://togetherwelisten.nypl.org/openaudio/talk/).

The hashtag for our event is **#openaudio**. Please use it to tag your tweets, Instagrams & other posts related to the event!
