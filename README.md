# Open-Audio

## Wayfinding  
Open Audio Weekend is being held in the Celeste Bartos Forum of The New York Public Library's central branch, the [Stephen A. Schwarzman Building](http://www.nypl.org/locations/schwarzman). The Celeste Bartos Forum is on the ground floor of the library and is accessable through the Library entrance on 42nd Street. This entrance is wheelchair accessible. Upon entering at 42nd Street, the forum is directly opposite this entrance. The street address of this building is 11 West 40th Street, New York, NY 10018.  

At the start of both Saturday and Sunday, event volunteers will be stations outside the entrance of the forum and available for questions. Throughout the event, staff and volunteers will be available to attendees. The hackathon is being held during public hours.

## Project Areas

## New to Git or Github?

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a file control system that lets people share and contribute to projects (called “repositories”), most of them software projects (but some people use it for other things, like [taco recipes](https://github.com/sinker/tacofancy)). Github (the website you are on now) is a company that allows anyone to host public Git projects for free.

We will use Git and Github to share the projects made during the Open Audio Weekend. If you're not a programmer, don't worry, sharing files in Github is as easy as dragging and dropping files to your browser! For a quick introduction on creating and updating a repository on Github, read the [Creating a Repository](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) and [Adding a File to a Repository](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository/) tutorials. There are more examples in the [Github help](https://help.github.com/). There is also this [great introductory tutorial](http://ablwr.github.io/blog/2014/11/03/non-technical-persons-guide-to-becoming-an-open-source-software-contributor-via-github/) on how to become an open-source software contributor via Github by [Ashley Blewer](//github.com/ablwr). 

You can also contact any of the event volunteers wearing the blue shirts. 👕

> **IMPORTANT:** All code you submit in the Open Audio Weekend should go to repositories you create in the [OpenAudio Organization](//github.com/nypl-openaudio).
